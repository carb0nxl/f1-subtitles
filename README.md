# F1TV Subtitle Issue Documentation

This repository documents a widespread issue with the F1TV platform's subtitle system across various devices and browsers. The problem affects all users and violates accessibility guidelines, such as WCAG and ADA laws in the United States.

The F1TV platform claims to provide English subtitles for all its content and states that it follows WCAG guidelines. However, the subtitles are either missing, incomplete, or non-functional across different platforms.

Furthermore, the F1TV "Disability" page (https://formula1.my.site.com/s/article/2023How-does-F1-TV-support-fans-with-disabilities?language=en_US) states that there is a phone icon for contacting support when there is a problem, but no such icon is present on the page.

This document provides five examples to highlight the problem with the subtitle system in the F1TV content library across various platforms.

For each example, up to three (3) screenshots are provided:

- Safari browser
- Firefox browser
- F1TV app on iPadOS

## Issue Description

### Safari Browser

Although the subtitles option is available, clicking on it only displays "unknown" for the language. Even after selecting the language, no subtitles appear.

### Firefox Browser

When viewing the same content on Firefox, there is no subtitle option available. Clicking the gear icon only presents the resolution option.

### F1TV App on iPad

In the F1TV app on iPad, the subtitles option appears as "CC" (Closed Captions), but no subtitles are displayed on the screen.
